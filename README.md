DIVSOUP BLOG BUILT WITH GATSBY + MDX AND STYLED WITH EMOTION CSS.

9/24 - started with GatsbyJS blog started but gutted things I wont use; image component, layout css file. Also cleared out entire code for layoutJS, headeJS files and started with clean file.

9/25 @ 12AM - added new styling to headerJS file. Imported css and styled from emotion core/styled and created a styled component for nav link within header. Added border styling to the link that a user is currently on by adding &.current-page to navlink styled component.
I create a template string ( font-weight: ${props => props.fontWeight || 'normal'} ) for fontweight to make it a little more flexible; this was just a bit of fun it was not necessary to add this.
